            <h2>Moses 4:1-2</h2>
            <p>
                1 And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten,
                is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son,
                and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.

            <h2>Revelation 12:7-9</h2>
            <p>
                7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels 
                8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
                9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he
                was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
